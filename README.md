# unit-4-game

The CrystalsCollector! game is a Coding Bootcamp homework assignment.

The purpose of this assignment was to create a game using jQuery.

How to Play:

The purpose of the game is to match the random computer generated score. Each gem displayed has been assigned a random gem size from 1 - 12 carats. The computer generated score will have a value between 19 - 120 carats.

Click a gem to add its gem size to the running score. Take note how many carats each gem contributes. By clicking the different gems try to match the target score. You win when you match the target score. You lose if you exceed the score.

After each round, the game will reset and display a new random target score, each gem will be assigned a new gem size.
